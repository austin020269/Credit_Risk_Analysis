# Credit_Risk_Analysis

UT Bootcamp Module 17 Challenge

## Project Overview
Create a machine learning model and analysis using different sampling techniques and the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries on the credit risk dataset from LendingClub by:
1. Oversampling the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms
2. Undersampling the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm
3. Oversampling and undersampling the data using the SMOTEEN algorithm
4. Comparing the two models that reduce bias to predice risk: BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier
5. Evaluate the performance of the models and their efficiency in predicting risk 

## Resources
Data Sources provided to analyze and minipulate included:
- LoanStats_2019Q1.csv

Software utilized for this study included: 
- Python 3.7.6 
- Conda 4.9.2 
- Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4
- Personal GitHub account

## Analysis and Workflow
The general workflow in running these models are to :
1. Read and clean the data
2. Split the data into training and testing
3. Resample the data according to the algorithm method (SMOTE, Naive Random, Undersampling, etc.)
4. Run the confusion matrix and show statistical results

### Deliverable 1: Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk

Specifically for this deliverable we did the following:
1. Create the training variables by converting the string values into numerical ones using the get_dummies() method.
2. Create the target variables.
3. Check the balance of the target variables.
4. Use the LogisticRegression classifier to make predictions and evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
5. Calculate the accuracy score of the model.
6. Generate a confusion matrix.
7. Print out the imbalanced classification report (see below).

### Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
1. In your MechaCarChallenge.RScript, write an RScript using the t.test() function to determine if the PSI across all manufacturing lots is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.
2. Next, write three more RScripts in your MechaCarChallenge.RScript using the t.test() function and its subset() argument to determine if the PSI for each manufacturing lot is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

### Deliverable 4: Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition (Analysis)
For this deliverable we are asked to provide answers to the following questions:
- What metric or metrics are you going to test? City and Highway fuel economy.
- What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis? The null is that they all have the same fuel economy vs the alternative is that they are different.
- What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why? An ANOVA test because it is a good way of testing the significance of the experimental results.
- What data is needed to run the statistical test? At least a population of 50-100 cars to get a good respresentation of all cars.
